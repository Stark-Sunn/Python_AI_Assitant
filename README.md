Voice-Controlled Virtual Assistant
This Python-based voice-controlled virtual assistant utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with users through natural voice commands. It can open popular websites (such as Google, YouTube, and Spotify), play songs or videos, and fetch the latest news headlines via the NewsAPI. With wake-word detection and real-time voice command processing, the assistant provides a seamless, hands-free user experience for everyday tasks.
